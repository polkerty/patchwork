However, the specific requests for changes are fairly detailed (whitespace, grammar, logic), indicating that it's past the stage where a completely new reviewer would be as helpful. The author is responsive, but a new reviewer coming in at this stage might not have much unique to offer, compared to someone who had been following the thread for a while. It also looks like the reviewer is iterating and providing focused feedback. Therefore it would be less useful to have a new reviewer show up. A new reviewer might be more useful if Bertrand had stopped engaging.

There are questions about the commit messages and whether the patch should be backported. Given the level of engagement from senior engineers and the ongoing discussion about the right approach, this is likely not a great fit for a first-time reviewer.

However, if the patches were smaller and the area less sensitive, it could be an interesting first review.

Several experienced developers, including Andres Freund, Amit Kapila, Masahiko Sawada, Hayato Kuroda and Nitin Motiani, are heavily involved, providing detailed feedback and suggesting improvements. While Benoit Lobreau offered to help move the topic forward, and that might include reviewing, the overall complexity and the depth of involvement from senior developers make it less suitable for a new reviewer. A new reviewer might struggle to grasp the intricacies of the problem and the proposed solutions, and their feedback might not be as valuable at this stage.

Andrei has even provided an updated patch with regression tests. However, the discussion around tuple_fraction and cost estimation can be a bit subtle, and it seems there's some disagreement or at least different understandings between Andy and Nikita on the details. Andrei's recent support and patch make it look more promising. The patch size is also relatively small. However, the underlying topic of cost estimation in Postgres is not something a brand new reviewer would feel expert at, and a misunderstanding could lead to bad feedback. So, a new reviewer could be beneficial here to provide another set of eyes on the latest patch, especially regarding the regression tests and the removal of the `*_ext` function. They could also try to understand the tuple_fraction discussion and see if the patch addresses the concerns. It's not a perfect fit, but better than many. The complexity of the patch is rated as 3, which isn't too high, and readiness is 2, suggesting it's not quite ready for commit but progressing.

The complexity is moderate (3 or 4), but the discussion reveals deeper design considerations and potential alternative approaches that might be difficult for a new reviewer to navigate.

The complexity score is also a 4, which is relatively high. The discussion about GUCs also indicates that there could be some deeper postgres knowledge required. However, Melanie Plageman's suggestions are relatively high level, so a new reviewer could see if the author has followed those recommendations in a new patch version, and if not, suggest them to the author.

While the patch complexity is rated as 3, the ongoing discussion around data corruption, statistics import/export, and the handling of `relallfrozen` suggests that a good understanding of PostgreSQL internals is needed. The later part of the discussion is mostly focused on edge cases such as VM corruption and stats import/export. Given the level of engagement from senior contributors and the intricacies of the discussions, it might be challenging for a new reviewer to contribute meaningfully at this stage, especially if the goal is to gain a basic understanding of patch review. The latest patches also remain relatively large and the last few messages have involved subtle questions.

Several senior reviewers (Peter Smith, Hayato Kuroda, Amit Kapila) have been actively involved, providing detailed feedback across many iterations of the patch. While the initial goal of the patch seems straightforward (logging a warning), the discussion has touched on aspects like configuration reload, error handling, documentation, and TAP tests, suggesting a deeper dive into Postgres internals. The back-and-forth also shows that it's taken significant effort to reach a state where reviewers give their approval, and new issues have appeared relatively late in the cycle. Given the existing engagement from senior reviewers and the iterative nature of the feedback loop, adding a new reviewer at this stage is unlikely to be very helpful and could introduce unnecessary noise. It also appears the latest patch came from Amit Kapila, and he made it after he incorporated some changes.

The patch has gone through three revisions, indicating some effort to address initial issues, however the readiness score of 2 suggests there may still be unresolved issues or areas for improvement. The performance implications and interactions with existing index mechanisms might be tricky for a new reviewer to fully grasp without significant background knowledge.

Several reviewers, including Nishant Sharma, Kirill Reshke, and Andrew Dunstan, have already provided detailed feedback across multiple patch versions (v2, v3, v4). The conversation is active, and significant changes are being requested (e.g., auto-creation of the error table, using typed tables). The complexity of the patch is rated as 4, and readiness as 2. Given the active involvement of experienced reviewers and the ongoing design discussions, a new reviewer might find it challenging to contribute meaningfully at this stage. They would need to familiarize themselves with a substantial history of feedback and design choices. The fact that several reviewers have provided a lot of feedback suggests it is not that far from being ready. It still needs someone to take charge to make sure that Andrew's comment about typed table is handled well.
