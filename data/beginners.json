Several experienced developers (Robert Haas, Masahiko Sawada) are involved, but their feedback is mostly high-level direction and requests for changes, rather than detailed code review. The most recent message requests regression tests, which is a task a new reviewer could reasonably contribute to by examining the existing tests and suggesting new cases that would cover the changes being proposed. The patches themselves are relatively small and have complexity scores of 2 or 3. The conversation is long, but a new reviewer could focus on the latest patch and the comments directly related to it (messages 9-13) without needing to understand all the previous context. Therefore, it could benefit from a new reviewer but also may be intimidating. However, the request for regression tests is straightforward.

First, the original patch was posted a long time ago (March 2024), and the most recent activity indicates it needs a rebase and is waiting on the author (December 2024). Second, a potentially significant concern was raised by Noah Misch in October 2024, suggesting an alternative fix. This suggests the existing patch might not be the best approach, and understanding the nuances of the issue and Noah's suggestion would require some familiarity with the codebase. The original author, Thomas Munro, seems quite senior which further makes this patch less ideal. Martijn Wallet did some build testing but also expressed hesitation on the need for further review.

The thread has stalled a bit (last patch was 10 days ago), so another set of eyes might be helpful. A potential downside is that logical replication can be tricky, so familiarity is good. But the presence of Bertrand's feedback, and the fact that the need for a patch was confirmed by Michael, mean that the reviewer's comments will be useful.

The discussion has evolved through multiple patch iterations, with performance considerations being raised. While the original issue is potentially understandable, the current focus seems to be on performance tradeoffs and alternative approaches, making it less straightforward for a new reviewer to contribute meaningfully without significant background reading.

The complexity scores are mostly 3 and 4, and readiness is consistently at 2, indicating it's still under development. The discussion also delves into deadlock scenarios. Because of the subject matter's concurrency nature, and the ongoing revisions, a new reviewer might find it challenging to contribute meaningfully at this stage without significant background knowledge. However, the presence of failing test cases (specs) could offer a focused area to start, by trying to reproduce the failure and understand the test setup and its intended behavior.

There are better places for a new reviewer to spend time, that will be more likely to result in them learning something and providing a useful review.","score":2}, {"thread":"a368248e-69e4-40be-9c07-6c3b5880b0a6@eisentraut.org","explanation":"This thread is very active, with multiple patch sets and many rounds of feedback from experienced reviewers (Peter Eisentraut, Dean Rasheed, Jian He, etc.). The discussion has moved into complex areas of the planner and rewriter. The most recent activity indicates that patches have been pushed, suggesting the core functionality is now committed. Therefore, it would not be beneficial for a new reviewer to start looking at this thread now as much of the low-hanging fruit has been addressed.","score":2}, {"thread":"CACJufxFiW=4k1is=F1J=r-Cx1RuByXQPUrWB331U47rSnGz+hw@mail.gmail.com","explanation":"The patch has been updated a few times, suggesting the author is responsive to feedback. The complexity is rated 4, which is on the higher side, but the size of the patch is manageable. The readiness is 2, indicating that it may still need work. No other reviewers have contributed, so a new reviewer could be helpful. Because of the complexity, the reviewer would need to have some background in index scans and constraint management. A careful reading could still provide useful feedback.","score":6}, {"thread":"42d3f855-2275-4361-a42a-826172ca2dc4@Spark","explanation":"This thread has had a fair bit of back and forth. Alvaro Herrera and Michael Paquier, both senior contributors, have provided feedback and made suggestions. Sami Imseih has also provided reviews. The author seems responsive and has iterated on the patch. Michael has even applied a patch. Given the level of involvement from experienced reviewers, the benefit of a new reviewer joining at this stage seems low. It's already in an 'approval' state with senior reviewers.","score":2}, {"thread":"8bb3af8a-796c-440f-b775-d05437b75e6f@eisentraut.org","explanation":"The patch has received support, but also a question about implementation details. Tom Lane's approval is a strong signal, but the question from Ashutosh indicates that there may still be details to iron out. The overall scope of the patch seems manageable, and understanding how the parser and transformer work is important. Therefore, a new reviewer could be useful by trying to understand the existing question and potentially asking further clarifying questions. It seems relevant, reasonably sized, and has some active discussion but isn't completely swamped by experts. Given the discussion, and that it is only a few days old, it's still early enough for a fresh perspective to potentially contribute.","score":7}, {"thread":"582b2613-0900-48ca-8b0d-340c06f4d400@eisentraut.org","explanation":"This thread appears to be closed. The author submitted a patch, received a review with suggestions, and then indicated that the changes were incorporated and committed. There's no apparent benefit in adding another reviewer at this stage.","score":0}, {"thread":"956435f8-3b2f-47a6-8756-8c54ded61802@dalibo.com","explanation":"This thread has been active for almost a year, with multiple rounds of discussion, various proposed solutions, and ultimately a commitment of the 'hard cap' approach by Nathan Bossart. Several experienced contributors including Robert Haas, Melanie Plageman, Laurenz Albe, and Sami Imseih have been heavily involved, offering feedback and suggestions. The final patch was committed. At this stage, there's little benefit a new reviewer could provide.","score":1}, {"thread":"CANtu0oiTgFW47QgpTwrMOVm3Bq4N0Y5bjvTy5sP0gYWLQuVgjw@mail.gmail.com","explanation":"The thread discusses a race condition related to serializable transactions and injection points, causing assertion failures. The initial approach of disabling installcheck was rejected by Michael Paquier, a relatively senior and prolific committer, who suggested fixing the underlying race condition instead. The author then proposed running injection_points tests in isolation. The latest patch is a rebased version, but the author also suggests closing the entry because Noah has already disabled runningcheck for isolation tests. Given that a senior committer is already involved and a solution is already being implemented, this thread wouldn't greatly benefit from a new reviewer at this stage. There's also some tricky stuff with isolation and serializable transactions that is probably beyond a new reviewer, so I'll rate it low.\n","score":3}, {"thread":"CAAJ_b96Bp=-ZwihPPtuaNX=SrZ0U6ZsXD3+fgARO0JuKa8v2jQ@mail.gmail.com","explanation":"This thread has a few concerning aspects for a new reviewer. Firstly, Alvaro Herrera has already approved and pushed several iterations of the patch. Secondly, Tom Lane, another senior figure, has also identified issues. Finally, a bug was reported and quickly fixed by Alvaro. This indicates the patch has already been heavily scrutinized and the remaining issues are likely quite subtle. A new reviewer may struggle to add significant value at this stage, unless they have specific expertise in partitioning and foreign keys.","score":2}, {"thread":"CAJ7c6TOyZ9bGNrDK6Z3Q0gr9ow8ZpOm+=+01mpE0dsdH4C+u9A@mail.gmail.com","explanation":"This thread has a few factors working against it being ideal for a new reviewer. Tom Lane and Michael Paquier, both highly experienced contributors, are already involved and have given specific feedback. Michael Paquier has even applied *part* of the patch already, which suggests a committer is actively working on it. Also, the discussion has shifted towards the appropriate placement of the tests (SSL vs. new suite), which requires some context of the existing test infrastructure. However, there's also discussion about the desirability of testing certain functions (inet_client/server), and a new reviewer could potentially offer their opinion on this aspect if they understand the security implications well enough.","score":4}, {"thread":"CAGMVOdsbtRwE_4+v8zjH1d9xfovDeQAGLkP_B6k69_VoFEgX-A@mail.gmail.com","explanation":"This thread has a long history with several rounds of review and revisions. Tom Lane and Tatsuo Ishii are heavily involved, providing detailed feedback and identifying bugs. Performance concerns have also been raised. While the feature itself (IGNORE/RESPECT NULLS) is relatively straightforward conceptually, the implementation appears complex and nuanced, especially considering interactions with window functions, EXCLUDE clauses, and user-defined functions. There are open questions regarding the design and performance of the patch. Given the level of expertise already engaged and the complex nature of the identified issues (memory allocation, performance slowdowns), it's unlikely that a new reviewer would be able to contribute meaningfully at this stage without significant ramp-up time. A new reviewer would likely be overwhelmed by the context and the specific issues being discussed. Thus, this thread would not benefit significantly from a new reviewer.","score":2}, {"thread":"ff4e59305e5d689e03cd256a736348d3e7958f8f.camel@j-davis.com","explanation":"The injection points part of the patch has already been committed, so there's not much left to review in the thread itself. It seems like the discussion has also mostly concluded. Therefore, a new reviewer wouldn't be very useful at this stage.","score":1}]
