[{"thread":"20231231.200218.1749113750714588065.horikyota.ntt@gmail.com","explanation":"This thread discusses a regression introduced in PG16 related to walreceiver connection timeouts during promotion requests. While the initial patch seemed straightforward, the discussion has evolved to involve reverting commits, signal handling, and potential issues with `die()` in signal handlers. Several senior community members (Heikki, Michael, Fujii, Andres, Robert) have already contributed to the discussion, raising questions about the best approach and requesting changes. The complexity of the problem and the existing level of engagement from experienced developers suggest that a new reviewer might find it challenging to provide significant value at this stage, especially given some of the more subtle issues being discussed. It's also worth noting that the most recent message is from May 14, 2024 so the thread is quite old.  The patches themselves are not huge, but the underlying issue might be a bit tricky for someone new to the codebase. The initial patch had a complexity of 3, but the discussion has revealed more nuances.","score":3}, {"thread":"bbaaf9f9-ebb2-645f-54bb-34d6efc7ac42@fujitsu.com","explanation":"The thread discusses a bug related to relfilenodes and proposes a patch to fix it. While the initial patch seems relatively straightforward (complexity 3, readiness 2), the discussion has evolved, and senior community members (Robert Haas, Masahiko Sawada, Michael Paquier, Kyotaro Horiguchi) are now involved, and their feedback indicates that the initially proposed solution might not be the optimal one. There's a question of whether temporary relations should be treated differently, and the latest message indicates that regression tests are missing. The conversation spans a considerable timeframe (from April 2022 to July 2024) with significant pauses, suggesting it is unlikely to be a quick or easy review. Given the level of involvement of senior developers and the evolving requirements, a new reviewer might find it challenging to contribute meaningfully at this stage without considerable prior knowledge. Additionally, the initial author of the patch hasn't replied to requests for changes since January, which also makes it seem unlikely that the patch will progress. I am downgrading the score due to the complex discussions, the involvement of highly experienced developers, and lack of recent progress.","score":3}, {"thread":"CA+OCxoxwsgi8QdzN8A0OPGuGfu_1vEW3ufVBnbwd3gfawVpsXw@mail.gmail.com","explanation":"The thread discusses a compilation issue on Windows related to OpenSSL and GSSAPI, involving header conflicts. The proposed solution is to create a separate pg_gssapi.h header file. While the topic itself might require some understanding of Windows-specific compilation issues, the discussion has converged on a specific approach. The initial patches were iterated upon, and senior developers like Andres Freund and Andrew Dunstan are involved, but there aren't many detailed reviews. The latest interaction involves Andres suggesting a small change (removal of an unnecessary #ifdef). There are no recent patches attached, but since Daniel has agreed to Andres's change, it seems like it is close to having a new patch. It could be useful for a new reviewer to look at the changes and see if the solution makes sense, or to even compile it on a Windows system if they have one available to test the patch. It could be a valuable learning experience for a new reviewer, who is interested in the topic.","score":7}, {"thread":"ZWlrdQarrZvLsgIk@pryzbyj2023","explanation":"The thread discusses a race condition fix.

Amit Kapila is also involved which suggests some tricky details. The author is also planning to explore alternatives, indicating the current approach might not be fully resolved.

Furthermore, different solutions are being debated, and there isn't a clear consensus yet. The issue also appears to have implications for EXEC_BACKEND builds, which can impact Windows systems. There's also mention of a buildfarm failure possibly related to the problem.

There are also some patches involved that contain code changes mixed with test case additions, with the most recent patches dating from Feb 20, 2025. While some patches have low complexity scores (3), the topic itself is fairly advanced and revolves around concurrency issues within core PostgreSQL functionality.

A new reviewer could potentially benefit from understanding the WAL internals, but should be aware that this is not a trivial change.

This might make it *seem* suitable for a new reviewer who could offer a fresh perspective on the default setting. However, the arguments presented involve considering the trade-offs between log volume and ease of troubleshooting, which requires some understanding of Postgres usage in production environments. The risk is that a new reviewer won't have that experience and won't be able to offer useful feedback.

The topic itself is quite complex. It also seems like the feature has been completed and pushed. However, subsequent reports of failures mean that there might still be value in additional review, particularly related to specific test cases that exhibit failures. So, it's not a *terrible* fit, but not a great one. The ideal scenario for a new reviewer would be finding some fairly small part of a patch that could be looked at in isolation, but since it was all recently pushed that's not likely to be a good approach. Even the post-commit failures appear to have been addressed. Overall it seems risky to have a newcomer get involved.","score":2}, {"thread":"7bed6c08-72a0-4ab9-a79c-e01fcdd0940f@vondra.me","explanation":"This thread is about hash join memory management, which can be a complex area of the codebase. The discussion involves senior contributors (Robert Haas, Melanie Plageman), and there have been multiple iterations of patches. While some individual patches are relatively small (e.g., `v20250218-0001-Reduce-the-impact-of-hashjoin-batch-explos.patch`), the context is fairly intricate. The original problem is tricky, and there are performance implications, so it requires a good understanding of Postgres internals. Also, the author has indicated that they have pushed the 'main part' of the patch series, suggesting that the core work is done. Therefore, it's unlikely to be a great fit for a new reviewer at this stage, but a new reviewer looking to learn might still benefit from reading the thread to understand some of the intricacies.","score":3}, {"thread":"Z7RkQ0EfYaqqjgz/@ip-10-97-1-34.eu-west-3.compute.internal","explanation":"This thread discusses the removal and subsequent re-introduction of `track_wal_io_timing`, a GUC related to WAL statistics.

The involvement of these two experienced developers and the ongoing discussion about potential over-engineering suggests the thread is now too complex for a new reviewer. A new reviewer likely wouldn't have the necessary context and experience to contribute meaningfully to the discussion at this stage.

A new reviewer would likely struggle to contribute meaningfully at this stage. Furthermore, the author has already addressed the feedback and pushed the patches.

The complexity is rated at 3, which is OK for a first review, but gram.y is a scary file to be looking at. The patch sizes vary, with the latest (unseen) patch being unknown, but the earlier ones were a reasonable size.

The recent suggestion by Amit Kapila to refactor the 'two_phase' parameter and the author's agreement indicate that the scope of the patch has expanded beyond a simple feature addition. Given the depth of the discussion and the involvement of senior developers, it's unlikely that a new reviewer would be able to provide significant insights at this stage.
