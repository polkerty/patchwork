Here's why: \n\n*   **Involvement of Experienced Reviewers:** Justin Pryzby, Jacob Champion, Daniel Gustafsson, and Tom Lane have already provided feedback. This suggests that the patch requires some level of expertise and attention to detail. Their involvement indicates some potential complexity and pre-existing context.\n*   **Recent Activity:** The thread is active as of February 2025, with a rebased patch and recent feedback from Melanie Plageman. This suggests a willingness to iterate and address concerns.\n*   **Patch Complexity and Readiness:** The latest patch (v5) is rated complexity 4 and readiness 2. This implies the patch is more involved, potentially requiring more in-depth knowledge of Postgres internals. The readiness score of 2 indicates there are still unresolved issues.\n*   **Nature of Changes:** The feature involves GUCs and logging, which are relatively core Postgres concepts, so some understanding is required to meaningfully review.\n*   **Specific Feedback:**  Melanie's recent feedback provides a direction for improvement. A new reviewer could evaluate this suggestion and its implementation in a future patch.\n\nOverall, while the involvement of senior reviewers and the complexity of the patch make it less ideal, the recent activity and the presence of actionable feedback mean that a new reviewer could still contribute by focusing on the specific suggestions provided and checking the implementation.

The complexity is listed as 3, which isn't too high, but the 'readiness' is only at 2, meaning there are still likely changes coming. Given that Rafia has already provided a detailed review and is engaging with the author, another completely new reviewer is unlikely to contribute significantly at this stage.
